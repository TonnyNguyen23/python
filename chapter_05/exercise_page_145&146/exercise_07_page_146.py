Problem:
   Describe the costs and benefits of aliasing, and explain how it can be avoided.
Solution:
    Aliasing can make the different signals becoming indistinguishable from one another.
    Aliasing can be reduced with the help of sampling, which is done at a higher rate than that of the Nyquist rate.
    The anti-aliasing technique is being used for eliminating the effect of overlapping of the frequency components.
