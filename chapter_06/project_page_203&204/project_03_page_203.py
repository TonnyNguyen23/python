Problem:
    Elena complains that the recursive newton function in Project 2 includes an extra
    argument for the estimate. The functionâ€™s users should not have to provide this
    value, which is always the same, when they call this function. Modify the definition of
    the function so that it uses a keyword argument with the appropriate
    default value, and call the function without a second argument to demonstrate
    that it solves this problem.
Solution:

"""
approximating = 0.000001


def newton2(x, estimate=1.0):
    """
    Calculate approximating square
    :param estimate:
    :param x: enter a number to calculate approximating square
    :return: the estimate of its square root
    """
    estimate = (estimate + x / estimate) / 2
    difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
    if difference > approximating:
        estimate = newton2(x, estimate)
    return estimate


print(newton2(4))
