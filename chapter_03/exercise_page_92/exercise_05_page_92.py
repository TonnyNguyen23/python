Problem:
    What is the maximum number of guesses necessary to guess correctly a given number between the numbers N and M?
Solution:
    we will guess the number in log2N times in the worst case here n is M and base 2 is we will divide the number by
    2 each time like
    assume 1-1000
    now we (1+1000)/2=500
