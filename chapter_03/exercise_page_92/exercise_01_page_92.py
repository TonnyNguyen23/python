Problem:
    Translate the following for loops to equivalent while loops:
    a. for count in range(100):
    print(count)
    b. for count in range(1, 101):
    print(count)
    c. for count in range(100, 0, â€“1):
     print(count)
Solution:
    a. count = 0
        while count < 100:
            print(count)
            count += 1
    b. count = 0
        while count < 100:
            count += 1
            print(count)
    c. count = 100
        while count > 0:
            print(count)
            count -= 1
